     <h2>Introduction:</h2>
     <p>An Operating System (OS) is a software that acts as an interface between computer hardware components and the user. Every computer system must have at least one operating system to run other programs. Applications like Browsers, MS Office, Notepad Games, etc., need some environment to run and perform its tasks.</p>

        - The General Motors Research Lab implemented the first OS in the early 1950s for their IBM 701<br>
        - In the mid-1960s, operating systems started to use disks<br>
        - In the late 1960s, the first version of the Unix OS was developed<br>
        - The first OS built by Microsoft was DOS. It was built in 1981 by purchasing the 86-DOS software from a Seattle company<br>
